## üìä Projects

### Project 1: Credit Card Fraud Detection
**Objective**: To determine which model performs best when data is reduced or augmented.

**Technologies Used**:
- Dimensionality Reduction: PCA, tSNE, UMAP
- Dimensionality Augmentation: SMOTE, BorderLineSMOTE, ADASYN
- Machine Learning Models: RandomForest, XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM
- Deep Learning Models: TensorFlow, Pytorch 

**Key Results**:
To compare whether dimensionality reduction or augmentation improves model performance, 
I used various machine learning and deep learning models. 
As a result, I was able to create a ranking table showing which method and model combination yielded the best performance.
